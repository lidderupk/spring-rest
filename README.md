# spring-rest

## Test the following API
	 * API version /v1/
	 * GET /books
	 * GET /books?offset=10&limit=5
	 * GET /books/{id}
	 * GET /books/{id}/{authors}
	 * GET /books?searchByAuthor=text
	 * GET /books?sort=ascending
	 * GET /books?sort=descending
	 
## The Rest API should use the following codes when sending a response back
200 – OK – Eyerything is working
201 – OK – New resource has been created
204 – OK – The resource was successfully deleted

304 – Not Modified – The client can use cached data

400 – Bad Request – The request was invalid or cannot be served. The exact error should be explained in the error payload. E.g. „The JSON is not valid“
401 – Unauthorized – The request requires an user authentication
403 – Forbidden – The server understood the request, but is refusing it or the access is not allowed.
404 – Not found – There is no resource behind the URI.
422 – Unprocessable Entity – Should be used if the server cannot process the enitity, e.g. if an image cannot be formatted or mandatory fields are missing in the payload.

500 – Internal Server Error – API developers should avoid this error. If an error occurs in the global catch blog, the stracktrace should be logged and not returned as response.
